# My Music Player
A (work in progress) music player that does all the things *I* want it to do. Now DELUXE! And TURBO. Designed to be small and simple. Feel free to fork it or bug me if you want a certain feature!

(Screenshot and logo TBD)

# Planned Features
- M3U-based playlist organisation
  - Relative pathing for easy syncing
- Supports MP3, M4A, FLAC, and WAV
- Library browsing
- Background file monitoring for changes
- Last.fm integration
- Tag editing
- Android/iOS (on the "nice to have" list)
- Free forever (beer and speech)
	- I'm making this for fun and to improve my programming skills, I will never ever ever charge money for it or any of its features
